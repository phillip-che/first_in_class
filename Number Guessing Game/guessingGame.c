/*
- initialize int variables for option, max value, user input, and the guess
- initialize a character string which will take in user input
- set max value to 10
- print out menu with options
- take in user input and assign value to character string
- assign guess to a random variable between 1 and max value
- if user enters option 1 prompt the user to enter their guess
- game returns to menu if user enters 'q' and continues otherwise
- parse the number inputted by the user and assign it to input variable
- if input is equal to guess print out success message and return to menu
- else if input is greater than guess then print out error message and allow user to guess again
- else if input is lower than guess then print out error message and allow user to guess again
- if user enters option 2 prompt user to enter a max value that is less than 10 but greater than 0
- assign max value to the new input by the user or return error messagea if conditions are not met
- if user enters option 3 end the game and print out exit message
